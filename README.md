# Unit-Converter
Training software, unit converter of several magnitudes of interest written in **Python 3.11** as a desktop application.

In *UI appearance.PNG*, you can find a preview of the UI.

For the conversion, a list of conversions from each magnitude is provided.
This list contains the values or expressions needed to transform any
secondary unit to the main one, which is the first of the list. The program
converts the changed value to that main unit, and then performs a second
conversion to the selected units for the final value. The order of magnitude
is applied within this process.

It is possible to add whatever magnitude and list of conversions to the application
in *Magnitudes.txt*, just following the rules stablished in the code's comments.

To change values, **up** and **down** keys can be used, selecting the entry,
or directly with the **mouse wheel** over them.
